#oclean: deletes the object files
#	fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
#re: forces recompilation of all source files

#	The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
#	The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail
#	You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
#	You have to use $(RM) for the cleaning up rules, but you are not allowed to set the RM variable
#	You are not allowed to use the string $(CC) more than once in your Makefile
#	You are only allowed to use the string $(RM) twice in your Makefile
#	You are not allowed to use the string $(CFLAGS) (but the compiler should still use the flags you set in this variable)
#	You are not allowed to have an $(OBJ) rule
#You are not allowed to use the %.o: %.c rule
#	Your Makefile should work even if there is a file in the folder that has the same name as one of your rule
